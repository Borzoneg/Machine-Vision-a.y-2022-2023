Answer a:
To calculate the homography between two images we have to know at least four corresponding points between them. 
Using SIFT features we can find those four points in the form of four beans

Answer b:
You can use basic computation, 
we know that when we have homography we can then pass to a image simply multiplying the point f by H to get the point in g
